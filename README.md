### General Purpose Processor 
This unit consists of different parts that would come together to create a functional ALU. A 
processing unit is usually divided to 4 distinct components. The control unit performs the 
fetching of instructions and signals. The bus controls access to data values throughout the 
processing unit - these registers act as temporary storage units. The ALU Core performs the 
arithmetic and logical operations on desired inputs and produces the required outputs. This 
project focuses on all four components of a typical ALU.
